# **AdaShip Project**

**1. Challenge Outline**

**Summary and review of the problem** 

*AdaShip Program* is a computer program adaptation of the well known Battleship game. 
Each of the two players will have a given board and a collection of boats of different lengths that they can place on their board. 
They will then take turns to try and hit their opponent's boats. If the targeted point on the board is part of a boat, they record a 'hit', otherwise they record a 'miss'.
Once all points of a boat are hit, the boat is recorded to be sunk. The game ends when one player sinks all of he's opponent's boats.
